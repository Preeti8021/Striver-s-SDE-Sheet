The two common dynamic programming approaches are:

Memoization: “top-down” dynamic programming, 
usually the problem is solved in the direction of the main problem to the base cases.

Tabulation: “bottom-up" dynamic programming, 
usually the problem is solved in the direction of solving the base cases to the main problem
